CS 300: Advanced Software Development
Portfolio Reflection

In CS 300, I completed two projects that emphasized the importance of data structures and algorithms in practical software development:

Project One – Analyzed run-time efficiency and memory usage of various data structures, gaining insight into the trade-offs between performance and resource consumption.

Project Two – Implemented a course planner capable of loading course data, sorting it alphanumerically, and providing detailed information on demand.

Approach and Problem-Solving

I began by carefully reviewing project requirements and selecting data structures that best fit each task. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of arrays, hash tables, and binary search trees was critical for making informed design decisions. Challenges such as parsing errors or edge cases in sorting were addressed by breaking problems into smaller steps, testing incrementally, and applying structured debugging strategies.

Key Takeaways

Early design decisions greatly affect performance and maintainability.

Algorithm efficiency and scalability are as important as producing functional code.

Writing modular, well-documented code improves readability, maintainability, and adaptability for future projects.

These projects strengthened my ability to evaluate, implement, and optimize data structures while reinforcing best practices in clean and maintainable software design.
